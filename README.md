# Official Codefresh pipeline plugin steps

This repository holds the definition for the official steps of the Codefresh marketplace as found at https://codefresh.io/steps/

The goal of the repository is to contain the "approved" steps that are managed by the Codefresh team itself. **Do not open Pull Requests for adding a new community step on this repository**.

Community plugins/steps can be created from a GIT repository on your own account. See the guide [on how to create your own pipeline step](https://codefresh.io/docs/docs/codefresh-yaml/steps/#creating-a-typed-codefresh-plugin)
