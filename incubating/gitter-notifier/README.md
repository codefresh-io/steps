# Gitter notify plugin

A plugin allowing to send any messages to Gitter activity feed.

## Using example

An example below sends a notification with information about the current build. A few Codefresh variables values are automaticly added to the message. Requires a git trigger

          You could see the build [here](${{CF_BUILD_URL}}) and the commit [here](${{CF_COMMIT_URL}})
      gitter_status: "info"
