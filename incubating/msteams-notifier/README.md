```

Replace the MSTEAMS_WEBHOOK_URL value in the Basic YAML example with the URL provided after configuring the connection

This is the only required variable for the notification to send out on a pipeline execution.

TODO: Add links to Codefresh imagery for connector or card usage.

Want to send specific notifications based on the pipeline failing or succeeding?
