# cf-vault-plugin

Use Codefresh [Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io) plugin to make key-value pairs stored in a vault available as environment variables for further steps.

NOTE: this plugin currently supports token and approle authentication and Key/Value secrets engine only. This plugin will not renew an Approle secret id TTL - it must be valid at the time of execution


## Usage

Set required and optional environment variables and add the following step to your Codefresh pipeline:

Example Variables:

The example below will authenticate to vault server `https://vault.testdomain.io:8200` using token `s.4wtaMJuZ7dv0c4XuRaasLUOG` and export all secrets found in path `secret/codefreshsecret` as ENV variables available for further steps.

```text
VAULT_ADDR=https://vault.testdomain.io:8200
VAULT_PATH=secret/codefreshsecret
VAULT_AUTH_TOKEN=s.4wtaMJuZ7dv0c4XuRaasLUOG
```


```yaml
---
  Vault_to_Env:
    title: Importing vault values
    type: vault
    arguments:
      VAULT_ADDR: ${{VAULT_ADDR}}
      VAULT_PATH: ${{VAULT_PATH}}
      VAULT_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{VAULT_AUTH_TOKEN}}
```
## Authentication

Although the AUTH and APPROLE variables are not listed as required by the step, you must pass valid authentication credentials to retrieve any keys. At a minimum, this requires the VAULT_AUTH_TOKEN as the default authorization method is Token based. If you would like to utilize Approle based authentication, please set the VAULT_AUTH_METHOD to APPROLE and pass in a valid Role ID (APPROLE_ROLE_ID) and Secret ID (APPROLE_SECRET_ID).
